# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

API keys can jeopardize data security when exposed to the public, enabling potential attackers to misuse them. The server-side sercures API requests by shielding our data from unauthorized access and potential vandalism. Additionally, hosting an application on a server allows for secure storage and management of API keys, minimizing the risk of misuse or exposure.
